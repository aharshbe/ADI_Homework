This is the first deliverable for the ADI course 04.10.2016, this submission is a little confusing so for-warning: :-)

Below you'll find an explaination for what each folder contains, I wasn' t able to get the app itself running to the level asked by the deliverable, but I was able to get most of the app going , what I couldn't figure out was how to integrate the control flow logic of the methods I created to the app buttons, which would then transfer the logic onto textView as an ouput. I reasearched a bunch and did what I could though :P (What I was able to complete I packaged and included in the files, as well as the methods with the logic to run all the needed actions, the pass/fail, grade and 5 times.)

The file entitled first_deliverable_android_studio:
	-Containts the android studio project file, it can be used to view my code.

The file entitled first_deliverable_apks:
	-Containts a compiled version of the android studio project which can be installed on an adroid phone

The file entitled first_deliverable_methods:
	-Contains all the methods that I wasn't able to integrade into the android studio project
	-I included this file to show that I do know how to correctly create the method logic for the app, all of the methods run and fulfill the requirements of the lab I believe.
